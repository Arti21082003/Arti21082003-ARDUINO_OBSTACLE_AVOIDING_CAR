# Arti21082003-ARDUINO_OBSTACLE_AVOIDING_CAR
This project is an autonomous robotic car built using an Arduino microcontroller. The car uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, an L293D motor driver shield to control four DC motors, and an SG90 servo motor to rotate the sensor for scanning the environment.
